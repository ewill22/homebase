# Claude Code — Homebase

Rules and context for working in this repo.

## Critical Rules

- **Never name a file `calendar.py`** — conflicts with Python stdlib, breaks everything silently
- **Never touch the `guapa` database tables** (`parcels`, `sr1a_sales`, `tax_list`) — that's business data
- **DB connection is `get_connection()`** (not `get_conn()`) from `db.py` — connects to the **homebase** database. Queries against guapa tables (e.g. `strain_stock`) must be **fully qualified** as `guapa.<table>` or they'll hit a non-existent `homebase.<table>`. Broke strain sync silently for 6 days on 4/18.
- **Don't stack stdout redirects** — if a `.bat` wrapper does `>> logs/foo.log 2>&1`, the Python script inside must NOT also `open(same_log, "a")`. Windows won't allow a second handle; errors surface as `PermissionError` and the real cause gets buried.
- **Don't swallow exceptions with `try/except: pass`** in nightly jobs — at minimum `print(traceback)` so the bat-wrapped log captures it. Silent failure is worse than loud failure.
- **In `commands.py` use `_get_config()` (the module-level alias), not bare `get_config()`** — the latter is only imported locally inside `cmd_home_summary`. Two handlers (`brief <team>` and `going to <dispensary>`) silently `NameError`'d and marked emails as Seen with no reply, because `pythonw.exe` swallows stderr. Caught 5/02 when "going to medleaf" produced no email despite the task running successfully.
- **After creating or altering any homebase MySQL table, run `bash scripts/dump_schema.sh`** to refresh `schema.sql`. The repo carries a frozen snapshot of every table so the DB can be rebuilt from scratch on a new machine. The dump script reads `.env`, strips `AUTO_INCREMENT=N` (churns every dump), and writes `schema.sql` with a stable header. Forgetting this means future-you tries to clone homebase onto a new PC and gets `Table 'homebase.<X>' doesn't exist` everywhere.
- **Always pass `encoding="utf-8"` to `open()`** — Python on Windows defaults to cp1252 and silently breaks the moment a file gains a curly quote, em dash, or any high-bit byte. Broke guapa_music summary parsing on 5/01 when 103 new editorial descriptions introduced non-ASCII; the bare `except: return None` hid it and dropped the music section from the morning email.
- **All user-facing HTML text through `safe()`** — normalizes Unicode + html.escape() + xmlcharrefreplace
- **Email subject lines must be ASCII only** — em dashes, curly quotes etc. break Gmail threading
- **Degree symbols in HTML must be `&deg;`** — bare ° breaks Gmail rendering mid-email
- **Task Scheduler uses full python path**: `C:\Users\eewil\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python314\python.exe` — `python` alone won't work since PATH isn't inherited
- **All tasks run hidden** — no console popups. Use `pythonw.exe` for direct Python tasks, or `wscript.exe` + `run-hidden.vbs` (in this repo root) for bat file tasks. Never use `python.exe` directly in Task Scheduler.

**Popup suppression:** Eric's PC uses PIN login (no Windows password), so "Run whether user is logged on or not" doesn't work. Instead:
- Python-only tasks use `pythonw.exe` (windowless Python, drops stdout — OK if script logs to file/DB)
- Tasks needing stdout redirect use bat file + `run-hidden.vbs` (in this repo root)
- PowerShell tasks use `-WindowStyle Hidden`
- Use `Set-ScheduledTask` (not `schtasks /Change`) to update tasks — avoids password prompt

## Key Files

- `commands.py` — builds the home summary HTML; also the email command listener
- `send_summary.py` — morning email entry point, logs to `send_summary.log` + `homebase_log`
- `strain_checker.py` — thin reader over `guapa.strain_stock` (used by morning email)
- `strain_sync.py` — collector: scrapes 12 NJ dispensaries (DispenseApp/Dutchie/Sweed), writes to `guapa.strain_stock`
- `strain_sync_run.py` — entry point for the 6:30 AM scheduled task (calls `sync_crops_catalog()`)
- **Terpene coverage is structurally limited — don't re-investigate.** DispenseApp stores (Conservatory, Med Leaf, City Leaves, Green Wellness) populate terpenes via their API. Dutchie stores (MPX, Botanist, AC LEEF, Brute's, Public Absecon, Juniper, Atlantic Flower) do not: the schema's `terpenes` field returns null and `terpenesV2` doesn't exist on the `Products` type. COA URLs (`canonicalLabResultUrl`) are null on 100% of Dutchie products too — the dispensaries simply don't publish terps upstream. AC LEEF additionally publishes no cannabinoid data. Probed 5/02 (introspection blocked at Cloudflare, POSTs blocked, GET non-persisted queries work but the data isn't there). Cannabinoid coverage on Dutchie (THC/THCA/CBD/CBDA/CBG/CBN) IS extracted via `_du_extract_cannabinoids` from `cannabinoidsV2`.
- `guapa_music.py` — parses guapa-data's DQ summary (coverage stats, editorial content, per-artist enrichment)
- `spotify.py` — all play queries filter `HOUR(played_at) BETWEEN 5 AND 22`
- `steps.py` — reads `~/.health_steps_cache.json`; monthly goal is 7,500 steps/day avg
- `health_steps.py` — full step CLI; use `--import-xml` to backfill from Apple Health export
- `odds_alerter/` — NHL playoff flip detector; texts via Google Fi SMS gateway when a pregame favorite's live moneyline crosses to positive. Enriches alerts with NHL CF% (Corsi shot share) via free `api-web.nhle.com`. Supports `watch <TAG>` email command for per-cycle score/CF% pulses. State in `odds_games`, `odds_api_usage`, `odds_flip_history`, `odds_watch`. 500-credit/mo budget on The Odds API — see `odds_alerter/README.md`.
- `dispensary_planner.py` — pre-trip dispensary report. Email triggers `going to <dispensary>` / `heading to <dispensary>` (conservatory, med leaf, city leaves, green wellness). On request:
  - Snapshots full flower/pre-roll menu via DispenseApp into `homebase.dispensary_menu` (one snapshot_id per call, kept forever)
  - Emails back: top sales (>=25% off, sorted by % off) + top 10 flower SKUs by terpene similarity to Secret Meetings (default reference; pre-rolls excluded from similarity)
  - Side-effect: writes a freeze-pane HTML to `iCloudDrive/homebase/secret_meetings_compare.html` (also `logs/`). **Always shows both Conservatory AND Med Leaf** stacked — every trigger re-scrapes BOTH stores so all sections show live data. Each section has its own sticky reference column, drastic-cell highlighting, and a "Total terpenes" row showing absolute loudness (% of bud weight). Open on phone via Files → iCloud Drive → homebase.
  - **Per-terpene values are normalized to share-of-total-terps**, not absolute % of bud weight. So "27%" means 27% of the strain's total terpene budget is limonene. This decouples profile shape from loudness — a strain with 2× SM's total terps but the same shape ranks as very similar (good for "find me something like SM but louder"). Distance and clone detection both operate in this relative space (clone tolerance: 4 percentage points per terp).
  - **Chemovar classification** per Lewis (2018)-style framework: every strain gets a `Type / Cluster / Subtype` label (e.g. "Type I / C / lim/caryo balanced"). Type from THC:CBD ratio, Cluster from terpene profile shape (A=myrcene/pinene "indica", B=terpinolene "sativa", C=limonene/caryo "modern hybrid"), Subtype from dominant terpene. Computed by `classify_chemovar()` in `dispensary_planner.py`.
  - **Terpinolene weighting**: distance metric weights terpinolene 3x. Reason: SM has 5% of total terps as terpinolene (a distinctive whisper for a Cluster C strain — most modern hybrids have 0). Without weighting, the relative-profile distance treats no-terpinolene strains as twins. The 3x weight is calibrated against the inventory: only 14% of flower has terpinolene >= 0.04%, so penalizing absence ranks the rare matches higher.
  - **"Terp whisper" row** shows ✓ for candidates with terpinolene at SM's level (>= 3% of total OR >= 0.04% absolute).
  - **"Loud-terpinolene cousins" section** under each store's main table — limonene-rich strains with much louder terpinolene than SM. Different feel (more cerebral / old-school sativa) but related family. Worth knowing about for variety, not for matching SM.
  - Manual refresh without re-scraping: `python _compare_with_highlight.py` rebuilds the HTML from the latest snapshots in DB.
  - DispenseApp stores only — Dutchie has no terpene data (see note above), so Botanist/MPX/AC LEEF aren't supported.
  - Reference profile is hardcoded in `_SECRET_MEETINGS_REF` — averaged from Secret Meetings rows with terp data on 5/02. Update if Crops genetics drift.
  - Clone tolerance default 0.05: tighter rejects even genuine SM (lab-to-lab variation), looser flags strains with real myrcene/linalool divergence. Calibrated 5/02.
